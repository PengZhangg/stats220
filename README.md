# stats220

This is my repo for STATS 220. 

A little about me:

- I am undertaking a degree in **Computer Science**
- I am taking *STATS 220* because I am interested in applications of data technologies and how they could be useful for my degree and my career!
- I am interested in learning about the R language!

A meme that captures how I currently feel about my university studies is:
